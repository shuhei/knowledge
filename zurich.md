## Japanese food

### Groceries

* YumiHana sells Korean and Japanese groceries. They sometimes have Kameda 100% Kakinotane, which is my most favorite snack. Also, Japanese-style bread (such as curry bread!) from Bakery Hiro Takahashi is great.

### Sashimi (raw fish)

Meat is super expensive here. We should eat fish.

* Frischeparadies has frozen fatty hamachi sashimi. Defrost it in a bowl of iced water. Simply amazing.
* Big Migros stores have tuna and very fresh salmon. Their salmon is great. Tuna is OK.
* Der Frisch-Fisch Mercato has tuna, salmon and hamachi. I tried tuna and hamachi. Both were OK.

## Craft beer

* Käsers Schloss in Markethalle im Viadukt has a selection of craft beer. Especially, they had my all-time favorite beer, German Movies from Fruest Wiacek in Berlin!
* Moby Hick's is a nice small craft beer store in Kreis 6.
