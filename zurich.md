# Zürich

## Public transport

## SBB

- The half fare card is worth the money, even in the pandemic. It also works for boats and cable cars at sightseeing places.

### ZVV

- Each of 110 and 120 worth two zones because they include the city centers of Zürich and Winterthur. That's why the cheapest ticket is 1-2 zones (1 zone for 110/120 and 2 zones for other zones).

## Japanese food

### Restaurants

- Ooki’s tantanmen is my favorite ramen in Zürich. Their other non-ramen dishes are great as well, which I don’t see often at other ramen restaurants. Especially, their tempura is great.
- Maru is a small imbiss in Zürich HB. You can get various rice bowls and udon noodles. They also have nice green tea (real matcha!) and sweets from Atelier Okashi.

### Groceries

- YumiHana sells Korean and Japanese groceries. They sometimes have Kameda 100% Kakinotane, which is my most favorite snack. Also, Japanese-style bread (such as curry bread!) from Bakery Hiro Takahashi is great.
- Nishi sells Japanese groceries.

### Sashimi (raw fish)

Meat is expensive here. We should eat fish.

- Frischeparadies has frozen fatty hamachi sashimi. Ask the staff and they'll pick it up from behind the counter. Defrost it in a bowl of iced water. Simply amazing.
- Large Migros stores have tuna and very fresh salmon. Their salmon is great. Tuna is OK.
- Coop often has salmon sashimi. It's not bad, but not as good as Migros'.
- Der Frisch-Fisch Mercato has tuna, salmon and hamachi (Kingfish). I tried tuna and hamachi (Kingfish). Both were OK.

## Bubble tea

- pao pao is a bubble tea shop from Berlin.
- Got Boba is another nice bubble tea shop, but it’s open only on Sunday.
- Só Tea has creative bubble teas and fruit teas.
- mì té has colorful bubble teas.

## Craft beer

- Drinks of the World at Zürich HB usually has beers from Fuerst Wiacek. There are two in HB. The one on the north side is bigger.
- Käsers Schloss in Markethalle im Viadukt has a selection of craft beer. Especially, they once had my all-time favorite beer, German Movies from Fuerst Wiacek in Berlin!
- Moby Hick's is a nice small craft beer store in Kreis 6.
- The International Beer Bar has a nice selection of tap beers including Lervig. It seems that they also Fuerst Wiacek once. There are nice outdoor seating with wooden benches.
- BIERlab brews their own beers.
