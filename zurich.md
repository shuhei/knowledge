## Japanese food

### Grocery

* YumiHana sells Korean and Japanese groceries. They sometimes have Kameda 100% Kakinotane, which is my most favorite snack. Also, Japanese-style bread (such as curry bread!) from Bakery Hiro Takahashi is great.

### Sashimi (raw fish)

* Frischeparadies has frozen fatty hamachi sashimi. Defrost it in a bowl of iced water. Simply amazing.
* Big Migros stores have tuna and very fresh salmon. Their salmon is great. Tuna is OK.
