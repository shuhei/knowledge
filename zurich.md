## Japanese food

### Ramen

- Ooki’s tantanmen is my favorite. Their other non-ramen dishes are great as well, which I don’t see often at other ramen restaurants. Especially, their tempura is great.

### Groceries

- YumiHana sells Korean and Japanese groceries. They sometimes have Kameda 100% Kakinotane, which is my most favorite snack. Also, Japanese-style bread (such as curry bread!) from Bakery Hiro Takahashi is great.
- Nishi

### Sashimi (raw fish)

Meat is super expensive here. We should eat fish.

- Frischeparadies has frozen fatty hamachi sashimi. Defrost it in a bowl of iced water. Simply amazing.
- Big Migros stores have tuna and very fresh salmon. Their salmon is great. Tuna is OK.
- Der Frisch-Fisch Mercato has tuna, salmon and hamachi (Kingfish). I tried tuna and hamachi (Kingfish). Both were OK.

## Bubble tea

- pao pao is a bubble tea shop from Berlin. I have never tried their Berlin shop, but it’s my favorite in Zurich.
- Got Boba is another nice bubble tea shop, but it’s open only on Sunday.

## Craft beer

- Käsers Schloss in Markethalle im Viadukt has a selection of craft beer. Especially, they once had my all-time favorite beer, German Movies from Fuerst Wiacek in Berlin!
- Moby Hick's is a nice small craft beer store in Kreis 6.
