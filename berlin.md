# Berlin

## BBQ

BBQ is allowed only in designated areas. [Here you are allowed to have a barbecue](https://www.berlin.de/senuvk/umwelt/stadtgruen/gruenanlagen/de/nutzungsmoeglichkeiten/grillen/en/hier.shtml).

The parks that I have been so far:

- Tempelhof - Fun. 3 BBQ places.
- Volkspark Friedrichshain - Nice.
- Fennpfuhlpark - A beautiful park.
- Mauerpark - So so.

Most of the supermarkets in Berlin are closed on Sunday and holidays. If you have a plan to do BBQ on Sunday or a holiday, buy food on Saturday. If you cannot make it, big statioins have supermarkets that are open everyday.

- Hauptbahnhof
- Friedrishstraße
- Zoologischer Garten
