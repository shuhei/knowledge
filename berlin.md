## BBQ

BBQ is allowed only in designated areas. [Here you are allowed to have a barbecue](https://www.berlin.de/senuvk/umwelt/stadtgruen/gruenanlagen/de/nutzungsmoeglichkeiten/grillen/en/hier.shtml).

The parks that I have been so far:

- Tempelhofer Feld - Fun. 3 BBQ areas.
- Volkspark Friedrichshain - Nice.
- Fennpfuhlpark - A beautiful park.
- Mauerpark - So so for BBQ.

Most of the supermarkets in Berlin are closed on Sunday and holidays. If you have a plan to do BBQ on Sunday or a holiday, buy food on Saturday. If you cannot make it, big statioins have supermarkets that are open everyday.

- Hauptbahnhof
- Friedrishstraße
- Zoologischer Garten

### Buying a Grill

According to [Tempelhofer Feld's website](https://gruen-berlin.de/en/tempelhofer-feld/visitor-information),

>Barbecues must be on legs at least 20 cm above the ground so as not to destroy the grass.

The cheapest and lightest grill with legs available in Berlin would be something like https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00009ENI7. I found one at [REWE at Rollbergstraße 59](https://www.rewe.de/marktseite/berlin-neukoelln/4040274/rewe-markt-rollbergstrasse-59/).

## Craft Beer

- Biererei - My favorite. Get beer in a growler.
- Biererei Bar - Nice tap beers. A beer cellar!
- Protokol - Nice tap beers including Russian craft beer
- Muted Horn
- Brewdog - Nice casual atmosphere. Delicious pizza.
- BRLO - A brewery in Kreuzberg. Interesting food.
- Straßenbräu - A brewery in Friedrichshain
- Birra - Italian craft beer
- [Muse](http://www.museberlin.com/) - A restaurant with beer by Fuerst Wiacek

## Japanese Food

- Daruma - A small shop where you can eat food and buy groceries. Authentic food like at a canteen in Japan.
- Momiji - Good Takoyaki.
- Marutai ramen (Oita) at Go Asia - The best ramen that I can buy in Berlin
