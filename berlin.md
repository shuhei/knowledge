## BBQ

BBQ is allowed only in designated areas. [Here you are allowed to have a barbecue](https://www.berlin.de/senuvk/umwelt/stadtgruen/gruenanlagen/de/nutzungsmoeglichkeiten/grillen/en/hier.shtml).

The parks that I have been so far:

- Tempelhofer Feld - Fun. 3 BBQ areas.
- Volkspark Friedrichshain - Nice.
- Fennpfuhlpark - A beautiful park.
- Mauerpark - So so for BBQ.

Most of the supermarkets in Berlin are closed on Sunday and holidays. If you have a plan to do BBQ on Sunday or a holiday, buy food on Saturday. If you cannot make it, big statioins have supermarkets that are open everyday.

- Hauptbahnhof
- Friedrishstraße
- Zoologischer Garten

### Buying a Grill

According to [Tempelhofer Feld's website](https://gruen-berlin.de/en/tempelhofer-feld/visitor-information),

>Barbecues must be on legs at least 20 cm above the ground so as not to destroy the grass.

The cheapest and lightest grill with legs available in Berlin would be something like https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00009ENI7. I found one at [REWE at Rollbergstraße 59](https://www.rewe.de/marktseite/berlin-neukoelln/4040274/rewe-markt-rollbergstrasse-59/).

## Finding an Apartment

Tips:

- Connection, connection, connection! Ask people around you if they know anyone who is looking for a tenant or a Nachmieter
- View many apartments. Even before you collect all documents, it's nice to start viewing to get used to it and figure out what you really want. I learned something new every time I visited a new apartment. There are viewings that don't require appointments in advance.
  - Most of real-estate agencies speak very good English. Don't be afraid even if you don't speak German!
- Documents: Collect the following ASAP. Keep copies in folders so that you can pass them immediately to landlords or real estate managers. Also preprae a PDF file with all of them in it so that you can sent it easily.
  - Copy of your IDs and passports
  - Anmeldung of your current address (if you live in Germany)
  - SCHUFA
  - Mietschuldenfreiheitsbescheinigung (a letter from your current/previous landlord to prove that you don't have any debt to them)
  - Evidence of your income (either of the following)
    - Payslips of the last 3 months
    - Bank statements with only income
      - Deutsche Bank website doesn't have a filter for income, but you can filter transactions by your employer's name
  - Cover letter (I'm not sure if it's really necessary, but you can show that you are serious...?)
    - self introduction & family members
    - gross family income
    - smoking or not
    - with pets or not
    - the reason for looking for a new apartment
- Tenant protection association
  - https://www.berliner-mieterschutzverein.de/ - There are lawyers who can consult in English. Online registration form is available.
