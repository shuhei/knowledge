## GitHub Actions

- Pre-installed software: [Software installed on GitHub-hosted runners](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/software-installed-on-github-hosted-runners)
  - For example, `yarn` is already included
- Regularly run actions: Use [`on.schedule`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events-schedule)
